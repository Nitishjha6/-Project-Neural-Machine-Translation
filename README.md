# -Project-Neural-Machine-Translation
The objective is to convert a English sentence to its french counterpart using a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. The language translation model that we are going to develop will translate English sentences into their French language counterparts. To develop such a model, we need a dataset that contains English sentences and their French translations.
